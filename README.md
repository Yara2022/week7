# Pacmen factory exercise from week 7. 
## This project involves clicking on the "factory" button at the top left corner to create Pacmen. The "start" button will make them bounce around the screen. I DO NOT OWN PACMAN! In the future I was thinking I can add sounds whenever they bounce off the walls.
